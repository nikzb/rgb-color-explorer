# RGB Color Explorer

## Version 0 - Work in Progress

To do:
* Try removing the Hide / Show color components button and just clicking on the circle group instead - will save tons of space
* Responsive css for various screen sizes

Super awesome version ideas:
* Make it so you can add multiple colors. When you add a new color, the existing colors get moved (or can be moved) off to other locations, and will show their code below them (hex codes will start with #). In this case, do we need a reset button? Maybe not, person could just refresh the page. But would need a "new color" button? Probably yes.
