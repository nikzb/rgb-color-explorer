# RGB Color Explorer

## Version 0 - Work in Progress

To do:
* Have the canvas draw the circles for the color code it receives via props
* Have the code display / input show the code passed down to it via props (hex codes should start with # automatically when hex number system is selected)
* Have the code display do validation on code it receives and turn red when it is invalid based on number system / bits per component
* number system buttons -(code should get converted to closest equivalent in new number system)
* bits per component buttons - (code should get converted to closest equivalent with new number of bits)
* Have Hide / Show Color Components button update state of display so that canvas image will update appropriately

Super awesome version ideas:
* Make it so you can add multiple colors. When you add a new color, the existing colors get moved (or can be moved) off to other locations, and will show their code below them (hex codes will start with #). In this case, do we need a reset button? Maybe not, person could just refresh the page. But would need a "new color" button? Probably yes.
