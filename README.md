Super awesome version ideas:
* Make it so you can add multiple colors. When you add a new color, the existing colors get moved (or can be moved) off to other locations, and will show their code below them (hex codes will start with #). In this case, do we need a reset button? Maybe not, person could just refresh the page. But would need a "new color" button? Probably yes.
