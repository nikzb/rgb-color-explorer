# RGB Color Explorer

## Version 0 - Work in Progress

To do:
* Tour
  * Cancel previous steps actions when the next step is begun (when someone clicks to the next step before the current one is finished)
  * Make a way to exit out of the tour from any step
  * Make a button for replaying the step that you are currently on?
  * Add the button for restarting the tour later, once it has been exited from

* Favicon!

* Share button(s) -- don't really need these till later


Super awesome version ideas:
* Make it so you can add multiple colors. When you add a new color, the existing colors get moved (or can be moved) off to other locations, and will show their code below them (hex codes will start with #). In this case, do we need a reset button? Maybe not, person could just refresh the page. But would need a "new color" button? Probably yes.
