# RGB Color Explorer

## Version 0 - Work in Progress

To do:

* ColorCoder tour - if someone clicks X to hide it, need to navigate back to level screen

* Look at what happens when there is no internet connection!
  * Either need to include font so it works with offline version, or need to tweak the fallback fonts to avoid ugliness

* Put up on Souvlaki.io

* Color Coder Game
  * Prevent backspace from navigating so it can function only as a way to delete characters with the keyboard
  * Add transitions between
    * level screen / game screen
    * game screen / end screen ?
    * end screen / game screen (via play again button - could me same as level screen / game screen)
    * end screen / level screen ?

* Tours
  * Add the button for resuming the tour later, once it has been exited from

* Favicon - Change ones?

* General styling
  * Clean up code for sizing of ColorViz?

* RGB Color Explorer
  * Prevent enabling button panel by selecting input via actual keyboard

* Share button(s) -- don't really need these till later


Super awesome version ideas:
* Make it so you can add multiple colors. When you add a new color, the existing colors get moved (or can be moved) off to other locations, and will show their code below them (hex codes will start with #). In this case, do we need a reset button? Maybe not, person could just refresh the page. But would need a "new color" button? Probably yes.
