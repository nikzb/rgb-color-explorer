# RGB Color Explorer

## Version 0 - Work in Progress

To do:
* RGB Color Explorer
  * Prevent enabling button panel by selecting input via actual keyboard

* Color Coder Game
  * Figure out why color display is starting open when guess display panel is enabled
  * Add end game screen
  * Fix size/styling/spacing of elements in guess panel

* Tour
  * Add the button for restarting the tour later, once it has been exited from

* Favicon - Change ones?

* Share button(s) -- don't really need these till later


Super awesome version ideas:
* Make it so you can add multiple colors. When you add a new color, the existing colors get moved (or can be moved) off to other locations, and will show their code below them (hex codes will start with #). In this case, do we need a reset button? Maybe not, person could just refresh the page. But would need a "new color" button? Probably yes.
